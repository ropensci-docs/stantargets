# Compile a Stan model and return the model file.

Not a user-side function. Do not invoke directly.

## Usage

``` r
tar_stan_compile_run(
  stan_file,
  quiet = TRUE,
  stdout = NULL,
  stderr = NULL,
  dir = NULL,
  pedantic = FALSE,
  include_paths = NULL,
  cpp_options = list(),
  stanc_options = list(),
  force_recompile = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- stan_file:

  (string) The path to a `.stan` file containing a Stan program. The
  helper function
  [`write_stan_file()`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/reference/write_stan_file.html)
  is provided for cases when it is more convenient to specify the Stan
  program as a string. If `stan_file` is not specified then `exe_file`
  must be specified.

- quiet:

  (logical) Should the verbose output from CmdStan during compilation be
  suppressed? The default is `TRUE`, but if you encounter an error we
  recommend trying again with `quiet=FALSE` to see more of the output.

- stdout:

  Character of length 1, file path to write the stdout stream of the
  model when it runs. Set to `NULL` to print to the console. Set to
  [`R.utils::nullfile()`](https://henrikbengtsson.github.io/R.utils/reference/nullfile.html)
  to suppress stdout. Does not apply to messages, warnings, or errors.

- stderr:

  Character of length 1, file path to write the stderr stream of the
  model when it runs. Set to `NULL` to print to the console. Set to
  [`R.utils::nullfile()`](https://henrikbengtsson.github.io/R.utils/reference/nullfile.html)
  to suppress stderr. Does not apply to messages, warnings, or errors.

- dir:

  (string) The path to the directory in which to store the CmdStan
  executable (or `.hpp` file if using `$save_hpp_file()`). The default
  is the same location as the Stan program.

- pedantic:

  (logical) Should pedantic mode be turned on? The default is `FALSE`.
  Pedantic mode attempts to warn you about potential issues in your Stan
  program beyond syntax errors. For details see the [*Pedantic mode*
  section](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/pedantic-mode.html)
  in the Stan Reference Manual. **Note:** to do a pedantic check for a
  model without compiling it or for a model that is already compiled the
  [`$check_syntax()`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/reference/model-method-check_syntax.html)
  method can be used instead.

- include_paths:

  (character vector) Paths to directories where Stan should look for
  files specified in `#include` directives in the Stan program.

- cpp_options:

  (list) Any makefile options to be used when compiling the model
  (`STAN_THREADS`, `STAN_MPI`, `STAN_OPENCL`, etc.). Anything you would
  otherwise write in the `make/local` file. For an example of using
  threading see the Stan case study [Reduce Sum: A Minimal
  Example](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/reduce_sum_tutorial.html).

- stanc_options:

  (list) Any Stan-to-C++ transpiler options to be used when compiling
  the model. See the **Examples** section below as well as the `stanc`
  chapter of the CmdStan Guide for more details on available options:
  https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/stanc.html.

- force_recompile:

  (logical) Should the model be recompiled even if was not modified
  since last compiled. The default is `FALSE`. Can also be set via a
  global `cmdstanr_force_recompile` option.

## Value

Character of length 1, the value of `stan_file`.
